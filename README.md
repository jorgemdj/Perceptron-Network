# Perceptron-Network
This program is a practical project related to Chapter 3 of the book 'Artificial Neural Networks for Engineering and Applied Sciences: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Aspects.' ([https://laips.sel.eesc.usp.br/](http://laips.sel.eesc.usp.br/livrorna/))  

It presents the simplest configuration approach for an artificial neural network.

The perceptron network belongs to the single-layer feedforward architecture, as the flow of information in its structure always resides from the input layer towards the output layer.
